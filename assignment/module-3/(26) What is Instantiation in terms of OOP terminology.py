# oops Concepts in Python

# (1) class
# (2) objects
# (3) inheritance
# (4) encapsulation
# (5) polymorphism
# (6) data binding

# (1) class
# -> class is collection in data member and member function
# -> Classes are created by keyword class
# -> Attributes are the variables that belong to a class
# -> Attributes are always public and can be accessed using the dot (.) operator

# (2) objects
# -> obj can be any property access in class
# ->  It may be any real-world object like a mouse, keyboard etc

# (3) inheritance
# -> inheritance is the capability of one class to derive properties from another class

# types of inheritance
# -> Single level Inheritance
# -> Multilevel Inheritance
# -> Multiple Inheritance

# 1.single inheritance
# -> Single-level inheritance a derived class to inherit  a single-parent class

# 2.multilevel inheritance
# -> multilevel inheritance a derived one class to inherit a multi parent class

# 3.multiple inheritance
# -> Multiple-level inheritance one derived class to inherit properties from more than one class

# (4) encapsulation
# -> class is an example of encapsulation as it encapsulates all the data that is member functions, variables etc

# (5) polymorphism
# -> Polymorphism simply means having many forms
# -> This code concept of inheritance and method overriding in Python class

# # (6) data binding
# -> It hides unnecessary code details from the user
